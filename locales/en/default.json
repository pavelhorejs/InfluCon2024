  "Clanek1Headline": "Influencer marketing in 2024: Where will it go and how to keep up with the trends?",
"Clanek1P1": "Influencer marketing is an extremely fluid industry, inherently shaped by social media trends, influenced by celebrities and technological developments. Statista estimates that ad spend in the influencer market will reach $35.09 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 10% over the next four years. And influencer marketing is no stranger to brands in the Czech Republic. What can we expect from it in the next year?",
"Clanek1SubHeadline2": "AI everywhere you look",
"Clanek1Text2": "Artificial intelligence is a great tool that will make the job of agencies and influencers easier - if used wisely. On the agency side, AI can analyse the content an influencer shares, see if they're collaborating with a competitor brand, for example, if they're compromising brand safety, what topics the influencer is covering and what their audience is. And it does this in a fraction of the time it would take to do a careful manual evaluation. At WOO, we test it ourselves on a range of internal processes. AI can help influencers edit content, generate topics, come up with descriptions... but it's not a good idea to rely on it too much. If AI is missing anything so far, it's originality. And that's exactly what brands should expect from paid collaborations.",
"Clanek1SubHeadline3": "Micro, local, nano and niche a.k.a. size matters and less is sometimes more",
"Clanek1Text3": "Smaller influencers are increasingly attractive to big brands, for several reasons. They tend to have more engagement, i.e. a loyal and passionate audience, a narrower and more specific range of interests that allows for more precise targeting, and they are usually more trustworthy and authentic because - by and large - they don't promote just anyone. This can be seen on the Czech market as well. We know from our own experience that big names and celebrities have countless collaborations across segments, and it is all the more difficult then for a brand in their feed to stand out from the crowd.",
"Clanek1SubHeadline4": "Long-term partnerships are winning for brands and (quality!) influencers",
"Clanek1Text4": "Why? Because recommending has long been insufficient, we all know that. And a long-term collaboration between a brand and an influencer is not only more believable than a one-off recommendation, but it allows you to build a narrative within the collaboration, diversify the type of posts and information over time, and keep your audience's attention longer than a one-off promo post. It also looks much better for an influencer when they trust a product enough to talk about it repeatedly, rather than changing their preferences on a weekly basis. By the way, you can tell a quality creator at first glance by that too.",
"Clanek1SubHeadline5": "It pays to look beyond Instagram",
"Clanek1Text5": "Although Instagram is the most prominent influencer platform, it would be shortsighted not to look elsewhere. There is, of course, TikTok, whose audience is dominated by Gen Z and the rest is the 25-34 category. If you're targeting the usual 18-34 group, you're almost 100% certain to hit on TikTok. But there's still Facebook and people over 35. No, they really aren't extinct yet. And for brands looking to reach 40s and 50s, Facebook is still a very relevant platform. Besides, Meta and TikTok are still coming up with new monetization models for formats and opportunities for collaboration between creators and brands. These are nothing but additional ways to incentivize both parties to create advertising content and increase reach and conversions in the process. That's handy, isn't it?",
"Clanek1SubHeadline6": "Diversify goals and metrics",
"Clanek1Text6": "Influencer communications has long been more than just a tool to boost awareness. What we've been seeing for some time now, even in the Czech market, is the inclusion of influencers at different stages of the buying funnel and at different touchpoints. In practice, this means that a well-chosen influencer can also serve to boost sales and, most importantly, that an influencer is not something you can stick on to a finished campaign, but rather a supporting element. Our recommendation? Think about influencer engagement from the start, plan your campaign so that influencers have a clear place and function, and set expectations, goals and metrics based on that.",
"Clanek1SubHeadline7": "Video content is the king",
"Clanek1Text7": "Videos have long had higher engagement than static content, and the popularity of platforms like TikTok and Instagarm Reels have contributed to their success. Video content is even preferred by search engines as it increases website traffic. But what type of videos to create? Generally, shorter formats lead the way, but if the content is interesting enough, viewers will watch longer videos, as evidenced by countless popular how-to's and tutorials, and catchy storytelling works too. In short, you have to have something to say. The chapter for itself is then the quality of the video. Authenticity, which is undoubtedly an absolutely crucial component of influencer communication, is inflected in all trend reports. But that doesn't mean that authentic = amateurish, or just plain ugly. As the industry evolves, the demands for quality increase and the output looks accordingly. Even with our clients, we see that nicer, more imaginative outputs usually show better numbers. Here you can see a few hilarious takeaways from last year:",
"Clanek1Text8": "What to take away from this? Collaborating with influencers can serve a brand very well, adding relevance and authenticity. But as the market evolves and grows, influencers need to be thought of in the context of other communications, planned well and measured well. And don't be afraid to react quickly at times and ride the wave of one of the moha trends. We're watching them for you.",
"Clanek2Headline": "Protection is Important. Even in Influencer Marketing.",
"Clanek2P1": "The events of the last few days have prompted us to summarise perhaps the least sexy topic in the influencer campaign process. But we feel it's simply no longer necessary. We're sharing our super secret know-how of agency-influencer framework agreements. Contracts are meant to help and protect.",
"Clanek2P2": "We sign a framework contract with influencers and then we sign orders/subcontracts for individual campaigns. Just for the record, our framework agreement is 11 pages long in large enough font with the most important points highlighted. Not because we want to bore influencers to death or lure them in for a bargain loan, but because after seven years of experience, we simply know what to look out for. We're protecting the client, us, and the influencers themselves. Somehow it doesn't cross our minds that there are still collaborations where no contract is signed and when there's a problem and it comes to breaking bread, it's like a divorce. Some of you may be familiar with this...",
"Clanek2P3": "What's the 11-page contract about? It starts with the introductory clauses and the subject matter of the contract. It needs to be clear who, where, for whom. That's probably clear to everyone. It's followed by Provision of services because, strange as it may seem to you, influencers are creating a form of content - they're providing a service to you and they should be providing it in a legally correct way. That is why you will find paragraph 3.5 in this chapter.",
"Clanek2P4": "3.5. The Influencer is required to clearly, unambiguously, and understandably indicate in each Post that there is a collaboration with the Client - the label must comply with the platform's conditions and must be placed first so that every recipient of the Post can recognize that it is a paid collaboration. The recipient of the post must not be misled into believing that the Influencer's Post is an expression of their own stance or opinion. The paid partnership label will be included in every Post created by the Influencer based on this contract.",
"Clanek2P5": "And here we'll take a little break and mention what has been mentioned several times already. It's not cool to not label advertising! We have it in our contracts, we also have detailed guidance for influencers on where to turn paid partnerships on across platforms. If there's a technical issue, we contact the platform or mention the partnership in the copy either in text or #. It's just not cool to not tag an ad and hope for higher reach like the unnamed ad on River in Prague last week. 9 out of 10 kids won't recognize an influencer ad, so why deceive them? If the influencer gets paid for it or there is some kind of consideration, even in the case of a barter collaboration - there is some kind of reward, the collaboration must be labelled. Amen!",
"Clanek2P6": "The next chapter is endorsement and disclosure. Collaborations with influencers can be part of an integrated campaign or can overlap offline and therefore timing simply matters.  Therefore, our contracts include a timeline and brief for content creation (more on that next time). This section, for example, determines how far in advance the influencer sends us content for approval. And also, we don't want to take away from the authenticity of influencers, but sometimes even if an influencer does everything right, they might mispronounce the brand name and it is very important for us to check the content before they post it, helps us avoid such failures.",
"Clanek2P7": "5.1. The Influencer must not post the Contribution on the Account or otherwise publish it without the explicit approval of the Contribution by the Client.",
"Clanek2P8": "We don't want to take away from the authenticity of influencers, but sometimes even if an influencer does everything right, they might mispronounce the brand name, and this helps us prevent such fails.",
"Clanek2P9": "Even when collaboration seems self-ideal, it's important to protect yourself. There's nothing worse than a client linking to a specific post, for example, on their website and a week after the collaboration, it shows up: 'Page not found'. This is where clause 5.5 of our contract protects us.",
"Clanek2P10": "5.5. The Influencer is not authorized to change published or approved Posts in any way without the prior written consent of the Client. The Influencer is authorized to delete or change published Posts only at the explicit instruction of the Client. This obligation of the Influencer lasts for the duration of the advertising campaign and an additional 2 months after its conclusion. The duration of the advertising campaign will be specified in the Specific Agreements.",
"Clanek2P11":"The chapter of declarations and obligations of the parties is a must have. Have you registered the Renault and Attila Végh case? Is it cool for a client/brand to withdraw from a collaboration based on the behaviour of the influencer in question during a long-term collaboration? Do we really need to ask this question? Of course it's okay. We get a lot of briefs from clients coming into WOO where the influencer specification states ,the influencer must not engage politically. Most big brands don't get politically involved and that's what could happen to them through politically engaged influencers. People will tag them. That's where influencer marketing is so tricky and it's one of its main pitfalls. In a collaboration, the brand/client is making it clear that they are aligned with the influencer, they want to be signed up to the influencer's work. That's why we've had clause 6.2.8 in our contracts for 6 years now.",
"Clanek2P12": "6.2.8. During the term of this Agreement, not to publish any negative reviews resulting from the cooperation between the Influencer and the Client, and not to damage the reputation and good name of the Clients or individual participants of the advertising campaign. In case of a negative experience with the cooperation, the Influencer is obliged to immediately contact the Client and communicate the reasons for their dissatisfaction;",
"Clanek2P13": "That's also why it's important to have a reliable influencer marketing partner in the countries. We work in seven markets in Europe ourselves and do you think our Czech influencer specialists from Prague office can handle everything? Of course not. Some places we have an influencer specialist who lives in the country, some places we work with a partner agency. This is exactly why it is needed. Anyone can find influencers in a foreign country and write to them, but to watch this social listening without knowing the language that, for example, a Hungarian influencer carries with him? We can't really do that.",
"Clanek2P14": "We probably don't need to specify the remuneration and the duration of the contract. Licenses are an important part. We don't want the client to be able to reshare posts on their own networks, for example. What would the collaboration be about then.",
"Clanek2P15": "Competitive arrangements are used to ensure that the influencer doesn't post a Coca-Cola post in his kitchen (for authenticity) while a pack of Pepsi lies very inconspicuously behind him. We've also had a big influencer publish a post on pudding while Bozkov rum was behind her. Not everything gets noticed and Bozkov rum got some cool free advertising. This was followed by a co-branding video for a cake with pudding and a drop of rum. No it didn't, but it would have been cool.",
"Clanek2P16": "We'll end with a sanctioning clause that we never used. Why not? Because we have well-built contracts! So let us know and our contract will protect you in this punk world full of unmarked collaborations without contracts. We're here for you!",
"Clanek3Headline": "Performance analysis of 140 influencer campaigns run by WOO",
"Clanek3P1": "Influencer marketing is nowadays quite a common part of online communication. Unlike other tools, however, it is quite difficult to predict results. Or... isn't it? We took a look at 140 campaigns worth almost CZK 20 million and found out where the benchmark for influencer campaign performance on Instagram and TikTok is in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.",
"Clanek3P2": "TikTok versus Instagram.",
"Clanek3P2Text": "Two key metrics were compared - CPE and CPM. These are also the most commonly measured KPIs that campaigns are optimised for, as increased awareness and engagement are what clients typically expect from influencer campaigns. In the campaigns compared, influencers are of different sizes and with different reach, but we do not factor influencer quality into the calculation, or rather, we know that it is reflected in the influencer price.",
"Clanek3P2Text2": "While the median CPE on TikTok is CZK 3.41, Instagram is several times more expensive, with a CPE of CZK 15.7. Conversely, the median price per thousand impressions is slightly lower on Instagram, 316 Kč versus 324 Kč on TikTok. We use the median value because campaigns from different segments are not equally represented in our sample and the average would be biased because of this.",
"Clanek3P2Text3":"However, when deciding on the optimal platform, it's also good to keep in mind the differences between Instagram and TikTok. Especially in demographics. Instagram has 3.35 million users in the Czech Republic according to data in Meta advertising tools, TikTok declares 2.5 million. That's still less than a million and roughly a third less.",
"Clanek3P2Text4":"Moreover, the age distribution shows that there is a chance to reach people who have moved past 34 on Instagram. Which is considerable buying power. And a well-chosen influencer can hit well even the seemingly insignificant 16% of the Instagram audience aged 35-44. On the other hand, if you're targeting the fairly common 18-34 group, then you're almost 100% sure to hit on TikTok.",
"Clanek3P3":"Age distribution of Instagram users in the Czech Republic",
"Clanek3P3_2":"Source. Statista, 2023",
"Clanek3P4":"Age distribution of TikTok users in the Czech Republic ",
"Clanek3P4_2":"Source. Start.io, 2023",
"Clanek3P5":"What about the segments?",
"Clanek3P5Text":"You guessed right, Beauty is the most expensive. If we compare the prices for impressions in each segment with each other, Beauty comes out as the most expensive one. It's quite logical because beauty brands are the ones who use influencers the most and therefore there is the biggest demand from advertisers. And the interest drives up the price. This is consistent with WOO's experience, as data from beauty brand campaigns was the most available for this analysis.",
"Clanek3P6":"Average CPMs on Instagram and TikTok by segment:",
"Clanek3P6Text":"There is still the question of barter cooperation. If we include them in the calculation with zero cost, the average CPM in the Beauty segment would decrease to CZK 411.28. With barter being roughly 10% in our sample.",
"Clanek3P7":"How many influencers are enough?",
"Clanek3P7Text":"Comparing the engagement rate, we have an interesting finding - the optimum is somewhere between two and six influencers, with engagement tending to drop off with more. That's why it's important to choose the right influencers and not just rely on having a lot of them. It's not enough.",
"Clanek3P8":"So how do you set up your influencer campaign - and your expectations?",
"Clanek3P8Text":"Making the right choice based on your campaign goals and knowledge of the influencer market is absolutely essential. The insights from this analysis can help you correctly estimate performance goals and see how a given campaign is performing against the market. Furthermore, WOO's experience shows that campaigns that can engage with a message or form, rather than simply recommending a product, perform better. So here again, working with experts is ultimately the best investment.",
